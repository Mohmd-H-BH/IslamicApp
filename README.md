**Build-Logic Module: Streamlined Project Management for Your Islamic App**

This repository houses the Build-Logic module, a cornerstone for establishing a well-structured and efficient Islamic app. It streamlines dependency management and project configuration, ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase.

**Core Modules:**

* **common:** Encapsulates utilities and helper functions common across the application (code reusability and consistency).
* **data:** Manages data access and manipulation (central repository for data models and interactions with persistent storage).
* **designsystem:** Defines the visual language, components, and styling guidelines for your Islamic app (cohesive user experience).
* **domain:** Encompasses the core business logic of your app (domain objects, rules, and use cases representing Islamic concepts).
* **ui:** Handles the presentation layer (building UI components that leverage the designsystem and interact with the domain layer for a user-friendly interface).

**Feature Modules:**

* **athkar:** Manages supplications and remembrances (exploring, memorizing, and reciting Athkar).
* **bookmark:** Facilitates bookmarking for favorite Quran verses, Ayat, or other content (user personalization).
* **onBoarding:** Guides new users through a seamless onboarding experience (introducing key features and functionalities).
* **OnThisDay:** Presents Islamic historical events or significant dates (current date or user-selected preferences).
* **prayer:** Provides accurate and timely prayer times based on user location (including Athan notifications).
* **quran:** Offers comprehensive Quran access (potentially incorporating translations, recitations, tajweed rules, and search functionalities).

**Benefits:**

* **Organized Architecture:** Enforces a modular structure (maintainability and scalability).
* **Centralized Configuration:** Simplifies project setup, dependency management, and environment-specific configurations.
* **Code Reusability:** Minimizes redundancy (sharing utilities and logic across all modules).
* **Improved Developer Efficiency:** Fosters a clear separation of concerns (developers focus on specific areas).
